# Confirmed cases and fatalities forecasting based on real COVID19 dataset using LSTM model

In the present jupyter notebook COVID-19 data from all around the world is processed, visualized and feed into LSTM model.

Neural network consist of three inputs: consecutive numbers of confirmed cases and fatalities concatenated with additional data from WHS,
as well as two outputs: confirmed cases and fatalities for the last day.
